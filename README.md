# Diabetes Prediction Using Streamlit
### Overview
This project leverages Logistic Regression for predicting diabetes based on health parameters. The model is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive web-based interface for users to input medical data and receive predictions.
### Features
User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
Logistic Regression Model trained on diabetes-related data.
Real-time predictions based on user input.
Data visualization with graphs for better understanding.
### Installation
##### Prerequisites:
-Python 3.x
-Required libraries: streamlit, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
### Usage
i) Open the Streamlit app in a browser.
ii) Enter required medical details such as Glucose Level, BMI, and Age.
iii) Click the "Predict" button to get the result.
### Model Explanation
i)Algorithm: Logistic Regression
ii)Dataset: Diabetes dataset from a public source or custom collected data.
iii)Feature Selection: Key health parameters influencing diabetes prediction.
iv)Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
### Future Enhancements
